In 2007 we, Marie José and Marco, decided to trade in our Amsterdam city life for the Heggenes village vibe. Along came Balder, our, back then, three year old son. We both had creative jobs in the Netherlands. Marie-José's profession being interior designer while Marco used to be graphic designer at an advertising agency.
While we traded in the city's concrete for the Valdes region wildlife, Jotunheimen's national parks mountains and trees, our passion for design did not stay behind. We put all our creative energy in this old wooden Norwegian farm. And so we transformed tradition into modern day luxury with an authentic atmosphere. Modern day luxury built on and mixed with the history and character of Herangtunet that anybody would love to have at home!.
It has been quite some years now, since we left our desks in the Netherlands to become design hotel owners in Norway. But even after all these years, we still can't get enough of the long and warm summer nights, the bursting flames of fall and magic snow-covered winter nights.
Our small luxury hotel in Norway still changes every day, every season, every year. With hard work, persistence, many hands and much help, we transformed an ancient soul into a modern, luxurious and intimate boutique hotel.
Embraced by the natural beauty of the nearby Jotunheimen National Park, the white ski-slopes of Beitostølen, the crisp air and an infinite galaxy at night, this is a special place, a way of life we invite you to experience with us.
